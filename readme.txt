VOTING SYSTEM

The following is a course project completed under the guidance of Dr. Clint George.

The following program can be used to create a database of voters and candidates and use those to hold elections. 
The first two files (used to create a database) are imported in the main file (main.py) where voting is carried out and the results are shown accordingly. 

Here, the file-
voter.py: is a nested function which is used in the main file wherein the user can create a database of the voters and alter it if need be.
candidate.py: is a nested function which is used in the main file wherein the user can create a database of the candidates and alter it if need be.
main.py: this is the main file which is executed. The above two files are imported in this file along with some existing libraries (stated below). This function is used to first create databases (using the other two files) and then conduct elections as well as display results. It also stores all information in text files.

The program imports external libraries: colorama, matplotlib.pyplot, time.
